## ðŸ“Œ Assignment Overview
This repository contains my solutions to **Homework 1** of CS5710 Machine Learning.  
The focus is on **function approximation, gradient descent, under/overfitting, and implementing linear regression**.  

For Q7, I implement **Linear Regression** using:
1. **Closed-form solution (Normal Equation)**
2. **Gradient Descent (GD)**  

Both methods are compared on synthetic data, and their results are visualized.
